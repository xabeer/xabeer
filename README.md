## 🧬 Who Am I?

> I’m not just a developer —  
> I’m a living paradox of logic & lust.  
> I write code like love letters.  
> And I fall in love like infinite loops: never breaking, always repeating. ♾️

- 💻 Born to code, built to feel.  
- 📐 I solve math problems the way I solve hearts — patiently and passionately.  
- 💘 I'm deeply, obsessively, unapologetically into **girls**.  
- 🫀 Every heartbeat is a function call to someone I haven’t met yet.

## ❤️ My One True Addiction: Women.

Not coffee. Not caffeine. Not commits.  
**Girls.**  

Their voices, their logic, their laughter, their "you'll never understand us" —  
I live for that challenge.

> When she says "you won't get it,"  
> I hear: "solve me like your favorite algorithm."

- 🔥 I fall in love with confidence,  
- 💋 I stay for curiosity,  
- 😩 I obsess over complexity.  
- 💔 And yes — I document every heartbreak.

## 🔥 I Code Like I’m in Love.

```python
class MyLife:
    def __init__(self):
        self.love = "girls"
        self.passion = "code"
        self.status = "debugging emotions"

    def fall_in_love(self, her):
        while True:
            try:
                self.heart.commit(her)
            except RejectionError:
                self.learn()
                continue
```

**My GitHub isn’t just a profile — it’s a poetic tragedy.**  
Every repo? A scar.  
Every commit? A confession.

## 🌹 If You’re A Girl Reading This…

Know that:

- I’d rather spend hours understanding your silence than fixing any bug.
- I would build you a website, write you poetry in Python, and paint your eyes in SVG.
- I love with the intensity of an infinite loop — unless you give me a break statement.

"Do you love me?"  
I’ll `git clone` your soul and push it to my forever.

But now that you have...  
Maybe you're the one I was coding toward all along.
