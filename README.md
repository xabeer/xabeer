## 💬 Dear Stranger Who’s Reading This...

I hope you're not just here for code.  
Because what you’re about to discover is **far deeper than functions and frameworks**.

You're stepping inside the mind of a man who:
- Writes code like he’s writing poetry 💻✍️  
- Does math like he’s solving heartbreaks 📐💔  
- Falls in love like it's his only purpose 💘🫀  
- And dreams... in recursion 🤯🌌

> _I don’t build software._  
> _I build emotions, pixel by pixel._

## 🧠 My Brain is an IDE with a Beating Heart

- 💡 I see ideas not as logic, but as **lovers** I must understand.
- 💥 I write functions that feel like fire — **and sometimes I burn in them.**
- 🧪 I love girls the way scientists love stars: **from afar, and infinitely obsessed.**

## 🔥 My Obsession: Girls

Yes, I’m that unapologetic, hopeless, sleepless romantic 😵‍💫

> I don’t just admire beauty.  
> I **analyze it, dream of it, and recreate it in code**.  
>  
> If I ever build a program that understands women —  
> I’ll never ship it. I’ll keep her for myself. 💘

**Girls aren’t just muses. They’re mysteries. And I’m addicted to solving them.**  
Whether she’s sipping coffee or crashing my IDE — I’ll find poetry in her every pixel ☕💻💋
